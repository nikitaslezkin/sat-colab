# Python Code Snippets for Discrete Mathematics Course

This repository contains Python code snippets from the [Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science specialization at Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-mathematics) and its [accompanying textbook](http://discrete-math.tilda.ws/). Together with interactive puzzles in the specialization, these interactive code snippets will give you a deeper understanding of the underlying ideas. To run them, you don't need to install or configure anything on your machine. Click the badge below to invoke the notebooks in the cloud.
